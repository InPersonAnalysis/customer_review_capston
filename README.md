**Preparation Files:**

- prepare.ipynb: Contains instructions for preparing the data and testing the prepare.py module.
- prepare.py: Contains functions used for preparing the readme's for exploration and modeling.
- preprocessing.py: Contains functions used for preprocessing data for exploration and modeling such as splitting data.

**Steps Taken:**

### Exploratory Analysis

<details><summary><i>Click to expand</i></summary>

**Exploratory Analysis Files:**

- explore.ipynb: Contains all steps taken and decisions made in the exploration phase with key takeaways.
- explore.py: Contains functions used for producing visualizations and conducting statistical tests in the final report notebook.

**Steps Taken:**

- First the data is split into three datasets: train, validate, and test. The training dataset is explored in the explore notebook and used later for training machine learning models. The validate and test datasets are used as unseen data to determine how the machine learning models perform on unseen data.
