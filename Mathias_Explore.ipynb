       "2015-08-04    I booked a table for two in the restaurant for 7 00pm on arrival i requested confirmation i was told the booking was now 8 00pm to accommodate others I insisted that it return to 7 00pm as i wanted to ensure my meal was digested before retiring for a 4 30am wake up call On arrival at the restaurant we were give a more than acceptable table with the restaurant only 20 full That is where the good story ends At 7 45 we had to chase the first course a small salad and a bowl of soup it arrived 5 minutes later Main course was simply two bowls of pasta off their specifically for cyclists menu At 8 15 after both table to each side of us had been given and finished their main courses off the main menu steaks and speciality dishes I had to chase staff again a few minutes later we were told it would be a couple of minutes it wasn t at 8 30 I went to the open kitchen and asked when our main course would be served in a few minutes I was told approx 5 minutes later the two bowls of pasta arrived unfortunately incorrectly I was served a meat dish which i don t eat I then took it back to the kitchen and in no uncertain terms advised them that i had now waited over and hour and a half to received a simple pasta dish which was not one selected apologies were for the hundredth time were given and i was promised immediate attention sure enough my pasta meal of ricotta and spinach pasta arrived in a perhaps 1 minute surprise surprise it was a bowl of pasta smothered in cream with a odd touch of green in it simply disgusting in both appearance and taste it was left my whole experience lasted 2 hours i didn t get what I had planned and as it was the last piece of the jigsaw before hopefully a good nights sleep and a hundred mile ride the following day    \n",
